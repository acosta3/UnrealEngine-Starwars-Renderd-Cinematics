# Unreal Engine 5 Environment – 4K Renders

This repository contains an environment I built in **Unreal Engine 5**, along with final **4K renders** exported as images.

The goal of this project was to practice building a full environment from scratch in UE5 and push it all the way to portfolio-ready stills.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Practice a complete **UE5 environment art workflow**
- Improve my **scene composition**, lighting, and camera work
- Get comfortable rendering **high-resolution (4K) images**
- Build a piece I can iterate on as I learn more game dev and Unreal

## 🧱 What’s in the Project

- A small, contained **environment scene** built in Unreal Engine 5
- Static mesh layout / set dressing
- Custom lighting and post-processing setup

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **Unreal Engine 5**
- Static meshes and scene assembly
- Material Editor & material instances
- Lighting (directional, point/spot lights, skylight)
- Camera actors & high-resolution rendering


## 📚 Skills Practiced

### Unreal Engine Workflow
- Setting up a clean project structure and folder organization  
- Working with the Outliner to keep the scene manageable  
- Efficient viewport navigation, snapping, and transform tools  

### Environment Art & Composition
- Blocking out and refining an environment layout  
- Using foreground, midground, and background elements to create depth  
- Framing shots with camera position and focal length  

### Materials & Surfaces
- Assigning materials to meshes
- Adjusting material instances (color, roughness, metallic, etc.)
- Managing texture tiling and scale to control the look of surfaces  

### Lighting & Post-Processing
- Placing and tuning lights to shape mood and focus  
- Balancing direct/indirect light for readability and atmosphere  
- Using basic post-process tweaks (exposure, contrast, bloom) to polish the final image  

### Rendering
- Setting up camera actors for final shots  
- Rendering **4K stills** suitable for portfolio use  
- Exporting and organizing final images for sharing
